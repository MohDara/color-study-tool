# ðŸŽ¨ Color Study Tool

An interactive web application for studying color models and color blindness simulation.

## Features

- **RGB Color Model**: Interactive sliders for Red, Green, and Blue channels
- **CMY Color Model**: Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow subtractive color mixing
- **HSI Color Model**: Hue, Saturation, and Intensity controls
- **Color Blindness Simulation**: Simulate different types of color blindness including:
  - Normal Vision
  - Protanopia (Red-blind)
  - Deuteranopia (Green-blind)
  - Tritanopia (Blue-blind)
- **Color Calculations**: Built-in calculators for intensity and HSI values
- **Real-time Updates**: All color models update synchronously

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with modern gradients and responsive design)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Interactive sliders and controls

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Use the sliders to adjust color values in different models
3. Observe how colors change across RGB, CMY, and HSI representations
4. Test color blindness simulation by clicking the vision type buttons
5. Use the calculators to compute specific color values

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. No additional setup required!

## Educational Purpose

This tool is designed for educational purposes to help understand:
- How additive (RGB) and subtractive (CMY) color models work
- The relationship between different color representations
- How color blindness affects color perception
- Color theory and digital color manipulation
